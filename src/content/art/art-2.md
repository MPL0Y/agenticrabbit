Edge of Tomorrow was a 2014 film starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. The story is about a soldier Private Cage who finds himself stuck in a time loop which he can escape only after defeating the Omega. No matter what he does, he ends up dying again and again, only to relive it all continuously. No one believes him, since he’s the only person stuck in the loop.

Last night, I realised how it’s the same with me—I’m stuck in the loop you’ve created for us. It begins when you come back and it ends when you leave. I wait for you in July, I welcome you with open arms in September, and you start packing your stuff in November. So don’t tell me it’s different this time, I’ve written our book and I know how it ends. I have flipped through the pages a million times, but no matter how hard or how gentle I run my fingers through the pages, you still leave in the end. So spare me the agony and just run the blade across my neck, slashing all my veins and severing all ties between us, like you did in the last iteration of our loop.

At the end of the movie, Cage meets Vrataski but she doesn’t recognise him at all, and he laughs—he was the only one stuck in the loop.

I hope that one day I get out of this loop and you forget me forever.
