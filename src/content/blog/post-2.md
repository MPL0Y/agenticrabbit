Don't hold back anger, unless it's frequent. If it's frequent, anger is definitely not the solution.

Don't carry umbrellas, unless all your friends have one too. Shared suffering becomes joy.

Don't take life seriously, unless someone you love asks you to. Everyone dies in the end, but it's easier to die being caressed.

Action is always better than inaction, unless unlawful.

Don't stop love from governing your actions. Desire is what keeps the world running.

When you're neck deep in shit, smile. At least you can breathe through your nose.

Don't let past lovers become dogs. Don't let yourself become a cat.

Don't rob the world of your energy. Cry and repent, smile and rant, but never suppress and hold on to feelings.

Do things for the sake of creation. Creators win in a consumptive world.

Energy loves pathways and hates dead-ends. Let everything flow through you and never pause.

Love without respect is just possession. And the things you own always end up owning you.

Never wait for the universe, unless you've tried 17 times.

What is yours will always be yours, but never wait. Energy mutates and always comes back around, but rarely in the same face and same familiarity.

Seek familiarity in love and challenge everywhere else. Love, by its nature, is always challenging. Everything else, by nature, breeds complacency.

Never resist. If it feels good to you, it must be good for you.

Let every thought pass, unless it's love.

The actions of your parents limit you. When your father is a fireman, you either want to be a fireman, or an arsonist. The trick is to choose a different passion.

Every moment in life is either a test or a celebration, but never both.

Mountains heal, beaches relax, and cities inspire. Never stay in the same place for long.

Figure out life yourself, and write it all down for the next person.

Fall in love with being proven wrong.

Let people tear down your boundaries, but never take them down yourself.

Hug plants.

Wear sunscreen everyday.

Keep your pants up.

Air your balls.

Worship the feminine.
