I went to Kasol last month. My family had been planning a trip to Shimla, and when that trip was over, it was time to break the news to them that I had, in the spur of the moment, booked a bus to Bhuntar from where a private taxi would take me to the beautiful village of Kasol.

Kasol is magical. When google maps tells you the village is 1 minute away, you have to ask the cab driver to stop just behind a river-crossing, which the locals refer to as Himtrek. The river is none other than river Parvati, and by the divine mother's grace if you find yourself crossing the river in colder months of the year, she will bless you with winds that will heal your heart.
